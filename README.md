# Seed_Dataset_Regression_LR_Model

In this repository, I have trained and predicted Linear Regression Model using Seed_Dataset.

**Linear regression:** Linear regression is a common Statistical Data Analysis technique. It is used to determine the extent to which there is a linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Also, evaluated the performance metrics for Linear-Regression Model.

**MAE(Mean Absolute Error):** MAE is the average of the absolute difference between the predicted values and observed value. 

**Mean Square Error(MSE):** MSE is the average of the square difference between the predicted values and observed value.

**R2-Score:** R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.
